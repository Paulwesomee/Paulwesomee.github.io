# 👀 About me

- 🔬My research interest includes Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and abnormal behavior detection among Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and IoT context. 
- 🔬I am also interested in Process mining, AI, Formal checking, blockchain, and its application in Business Intelligence(BI), Industrial management, Digital twins, and other contexts such as Industry 4.0/5.0 and Smart hospital, from a security or optimization angle.
- 🗣️I speak advanced English (C1-C2 level), and I also have an intermediate level of French. I have been working as an English teacher for Chinese students for 3 years and that supports most of my tuition fees.
